Two videos as examples on how our dual deep learning architecture (RBCNet) works.

Both of the videos have 4 quarters.

Quarter 1 (Upper Left): Displays the connected components (CC) of the U-Net mask with black rectangular to refer to the current CC that is being processed.

Quarter 2 (Lower Left): Displays one connected component from the U-Net mask (cluster) at a time.

Quarter 3 (Lower Right): Displays the raw image cluster corresponding to the U-Net connected component detected by Faster R-CNN.

Quarter 4 (Upper Right): Displays all the bounding boxes of all the detected RBCs after superimposed the cluster detection on the raw image with black 
			rectangular synchronized with the black rectangular in quarter 1. Quarter 4 has also a counter to count the number of RBCs.
